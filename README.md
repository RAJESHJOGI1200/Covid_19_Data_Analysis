# COVID-19 Data Analysis  

This project explores **COVID-19 data** using **SQL** to analyze trends, infection rates, death percentages, and vaccination progress. The dataset includes global COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination records. The goal is to extract meaningful insights to understand the pandemic's impact across different countries and continents.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is for **educational purposes only**. The data used is publicly available and may not reflect real-time statistics.

## 📊 Key Objectives  

- Analyze **COVID-19 cases, deaths, and infection rates** globally and by country.  
- Identify **countries with the highest infection and death rates** per population.  
- Compare **total cases vs. total deaths** to determine the likelihood of mortality.  
- Track **vaccination progress** and determine the percentage of the population vaccinated.

## 🛠️ Skills Used  

- SQL Queries  
- Joins & Aggregate Functions  
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)  
- Window Functions  
- Temporary Tables  
- Views & Data Type Conversions

## 🔍 Analysis Performed  

### **1. COVID-19 Infection & Mortality Analysis**  
- Calculated the **death percentage** by dividing total deaths by total cases per country.  
- Identified **countries with the highest infection rates** compared to their population.  
- Analyzed **continent-wise death rates** to determine the most affected regions.  

### **2. Global Impact Assessment**  
- Summarized **total cases, total deaths, and overall death percentage** worldwide.  
- Used **window functions** to rank countries based on the highest death counts.  

### **3. Vaccination Analysis**  
- Examined **vaccination progress** using cumulative counts of people vaccinated.  
- Created **rolling vaccination counts** using window functions and CTEs.  
- Calculated **percentage of population vaccinated** per country.
